Feature: To test user registration with service calls

              As a user, i want to test the user registration through sample api calls and
    validate that the user is registered successfully

        # Sample scenario with no endpoint - endpoint can be placed in config/data.
        # Tested on actual endpoint and is working fine

        Scenario: Create a new user and register it on a dummy endpoint or environment

          Given User details are provided
          When User is successfully registered througn api calls
